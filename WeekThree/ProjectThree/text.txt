My name is Marc Teixeira. I have recently acquired my Associates degree in Mathematics and Engineering from San Diego Mesa College. I started going to a 4-Year institution in 2001 but the pressure ended up being too much for me to bear and I inevitably dropped out.  In 2015 I had decided that it was time for me to give college another try and enrolled in a local community college. Attending GCU is the final step I need to take to receive my Bachelor of Science degree.
I work in construction or more appropriately deconstruction as a heavy equipment operator. The company I work for is a family business, so naturally I got roped in when I was young. While driving around on big machines can be fun at times, I dislike my job very much. Getting my degree is going to help me break away from my familyâ€™s business. My true passion is software design and programming. I have always loved to mess around with the inner workings of computers.
Most of my time is taken up by work but when I am not working, I usually spend time with my beautiful wife and our 10-year-old son. I cannot believe how much homework they give kids these days. It usually takes my son and I at least 3 hours to get through all his homework. My work takes me all over the City of San Diego, so it is not unusual for it to take me an hour or more to get to work. Audiobooks have become a relief to me going to and from work. When I do get a moment to myself, I like to watch Netflix or any e-sports that might be going on at the time. 
For many years I have been unhappy with my current job situation. Getting my degree should finally help me start a career in something I enjoy. While the idea of going out and finding a new job in a field I have no practical experience in is terrifying, I am determined to change my life for the better. Receiving this degree is not only about obtaining a new career, it is also about personal goals I set myself a long time ago. 
Respectfully,
Marc Teixeira
